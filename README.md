# Brain-games

### Introduction
This is my first pet-project for creating simple console games. I took the base idea from Hexlet (educational platform for teaching programming) and a little bit improved it.

### Installation

- To install brain-games:

```
$ python3 -m pip install --user git+https://github.com/verafadeeva/simple-console-games.git
```
*The package is made with Poetry, so pip version should be ^22.3.1 (maybe)*

- To uninstall  brain-games:
```
$ python3 -m pip uninstall brain-games
```

### Usage

Just run this:
```
$ brain-games
```
